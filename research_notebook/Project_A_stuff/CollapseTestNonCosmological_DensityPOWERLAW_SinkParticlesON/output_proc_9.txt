****************************************************************************
* hwloc 1.11.2 has encountered what looks like an error from the operating system.
*
* L3 (cpuset 0x000003f0) intersects with NUMANode (P#0 cpuset 0x0000003f) without inclusion!
* Error occurred in topology.c line 1046
*
* The following FAQ entry in the hwloc documentation may help:
*   What should I do when hwloc reports "operating system" warnings?
* Otherwise please report this error message to the hwloc user's mailing list,
* along with the output+tarball generated by the hwloc-gather-topology script.

Failure reported on processor 5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
MPI_ABORT was invoked on rank 5 in communicator MPI_COMM_WORLD 
with errorcode 1.

NOTE: invoking MPI_ABORT causes Open MPI to kill all MPI processes.
You may or may not see output from other processes, depending on
exactly when Open MPI kills them.
